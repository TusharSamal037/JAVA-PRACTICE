<p><h2>👋 Hi, I’m Tushar!</h2></p>
<h3>I’m a beginner web developer who loves turning ideas into simple and interactive web pages. I’ve started my journey with small but fun projects like a Movie Ranking website and a Birthday Invitation page, and I’m excited to keep building more.

My goal is to learn modern web technologies step by step and grow into a full-stack developer. For now, I’m focusing on improving my <u>HTML</u>, <u>CSS</u>, and <u>JavaScript</u> skills while exploring frameworks and tools along the way.

When I’m not coding, I enjoy learning new things, solving problems, and experimenting with creative ideas. This portfolio will keep evolving as I build more projects—stay tuned! 🚀</h3>
